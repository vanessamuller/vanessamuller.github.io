          <p>The Little Prince (French: Le Petit Prince; French pronunciation: ​[lə pəti pʁɛ̃s]), first published in 1943,
             is a novella, the most famous work of French aristocrat, writer, poet, and pioneering aviator Antoine de
             Saint-Exupéry (1900–1944).

            The novella is one of the most-translated books in the world and was voted the best book of the 20th century
             in France. Translated into more than 250 languages and dialects (as well as Braille),selling nearly
              two million copies annually with sales totaling over 140 million copies worldwide, it has become one
              of the best-selling books ever published.

              After the outbreak of the Second World War Saint-Exupéry was exiled to North America. In the midst
              of personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would
               be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss, in the form of a
               young prince fallen to Earth. An earlier memoir by the author had recounted his aviation experiences
               in the Sahara Desert, and he is thought to have drawn on those same experiences in The Little Prince.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center author-title">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</h2>
        <div class="author-text"><p>Antoine Marie Jean-Baptiste Roger, comte de Saint-Exupéry; 29 June 1900 – 31 July 1944 was a French writer,
           poet, aristocrat, journalist, and pioneering aviator. He became a laureate of several of France's highest
           literary awards and also won the U.S. National Book Award.[6] He is best remembered for his novella The
           Little Prince (Le Petit Prince) and for his lyrical aviation writings, including Wind, Sand and Stars and
           Night Flight.

           Saint-Exupéry was a successful commercial pilot before World War II, working airmail routes in Europe,
           Africa and South America. At the outbreak of war, he joined the French Air Force (Armée de l'Air), flying
           reconnaissance missions until France's armistice with Germany in 1940. After being demobilised from the
           French Air Force, he travelled to the United States to persuade its government to enter the war against
           Nazi Germany. Following a 27-month hiatus in North America, during which he wrote three of his most
           important works, he joined the Free French Air Force in North Africa, although he was far past the maximum
           age for such pilots and in declining health. He disappeared over the Mediterranean on a reconnaissance
           mission in July 1944, and is believed to have died at that time.

           Prior to the war, Saint-Exupéry had achieved fame in France as an aviator. His literary works – among them
           The Little Prince, translated into over 250 languages and dialects – posthumously boosted his stature to
           national hero status in France. He earned further widespread recognition with international
           translations of his other works. His 1939 philosophical memoir Terre des hommes—Man and His World became
           the name of an international humanitarian group, and was also used to create the central theme of the most
           successful world's fair of the 20th century, Expo 67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry#Literary_works">Read More</a></div>
