            <p class="story-text">The first Polar beer was made in 1941 in a small brewery located in antimano, west of Carcacas. Then, in 1943
            brew master Carlos Roubicek started in Polar brewery and changed the recipe for the beer, making it the number one
          venezuelan beer in sales, also having some advantage as it was one of the few beers in the market at the time.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">Between 1999 and 2002, there was a change in consumer preferences in Venezuela, which
            lead to the original Polar beer to lose the number one spot to light beers. Since
          2008, Polar Light has changed the preferences again and became number one.</p>
